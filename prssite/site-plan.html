      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Have you ever had a "that should be a t-shirt?" I am working for a company that is currently making it so that those moments don't have to just be moments. How it works is that they take your order, whatever it may be, then they have a commissioned batch of artist create your t-shirt, then we deliver it to you. I am currently developing their website where you can create your own custom-made t-shirt.</p>  <!-- change this -->
